# Invoice Generator Roadmap

## Summary
A simple web application to create, manage, and download professional invoices. Built with Next.js for both the frontend (React-based components) and backend (API routes), styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern UI, and deployed on Vercel to leverage serverless functions.

## Key Features
- Intuitive form for creating and editing invoice details
- Dynamic item list with quantity, price, and tax calculations
- Automated subtotal and total calculations
- Option to preview and download the invoice as a PDF
- Simple theme switcher (light/dark)

## Roadmap

### 1. Project Setup
1. Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Organize project structure:
   - `/pages` for routes
   - `/pages/api` for serverless functions
   - `/components` for modular UI elements
4. Initialize version control (Git) and set up repository on a platform like GitHub.

### 2. Basic Invoice Form
1. Create an `InvoiceForm` component to capture invoice data:
   - Invoice number, date, due date
   - Business details (name, address, email, phone)
   - Client details (name, address, email)
2. Use Tailwind for layout: grids and flex utilities for a clean design.
3. Store form input values with React state.

### 3. Items Management
1. Add a dynamic items array in React state.
2. Provide fields for description, quantity, and price.
3. Implement “Add Item” and “Remove Item” buttons.
4. Calculate subtotal by summing each item's total (quantity × price).
5. Optional: add a tax rate input, calculating total cost with tax.

### 4. Invoice Preview
1. Create an `InvoicePreview` component to display invoice info in a print-friendly layout.
2. Use a modal or a dedicated page for previewing.
3. Apply formatting styles (borders, spacing, typography) for a professional PDF look.

### 5. PDF Generation (API Route)
1. Create a `/pages/api/generate-pdf.js` file.
2. Install `puppeteer` or a similar library to handle PDF creation on the server.
3. Send invoice data (via POST request) to the API route to render an HTML invoice.
4. Generate a PDF buffer, return it to the client with appropriate headers.
5. Trigger file download in the client after receiving the PDF.

### 6. Theming
1. Add a theme toggle (light/dark) using Tailwind’s dark mode feature.
2. Provide a user-friendly toggle (switch or button).
3. Ensure consistent color usage across components.

### 7. Deployment
1. Connect the project repository to Vercel.
2. Configure environment variables if needed.
3. Verify that serverless functions (the PDF generation API route) work correctly.
4. Test the invoice creation and download processes in production.

### 9. Testing & QA
1. Write integration tests for form submission and PDF generation.
2. Check cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. Collect user feedback on UI design and performance.
4. Perform final optimizations (image optimization, code splitting).

### 10. Launch & Maintenance
1. Communicate launch to potential users.
2. Monitor Vercel analytics for performance data.
3. Address issues or feature requests.
4. Plan iterative improvements, such as more advanced invoice customization or analytics.

## Final Goal
Have a fully functional invoice generator app that:
- Is easy to maintain and extend.
- Lets users quickly create, preview, and download invoices.
- Provides a modern, responsive UI thanks to Tailwind CSS.
- Uses Next.js API routes for server-side logic without a separate backend server.
